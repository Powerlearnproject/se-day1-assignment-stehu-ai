Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
1
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is creating solutions to problems identified through maintenance of high-quality software systems. It's important in the sense that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life e.g communication, healthcare and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The establishment of software engineering in the 1960s
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement
One is required to gather and document user needs and system requirements
2. Design
One is required to create high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implement
One is required to write code and build the software according to the design specifications.
4. Test
One is required to conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deploy
One is required to release the software to the users or customers.
6. Maintenance
One is required to provide ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology follows a systematic sequence of events beginning from the top to the bottom e.g during the development of a software it tends to follow the phases of life cycle from the requirement to maintenance while the agile methodology uses iterative and incremental approach focused on collaboration and response to change i.e where an application is improved by repeated review and testing. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer
The developer writes code and implements software solution.
2. Quality Assurance Manager
The manager ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager
The manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs 
These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio, eclipse, intelliJ, IDEA
VCS
These are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinate work among team members e.g git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements
2. Tight Deadlines
3. Technical Debt
   Strategies
   1. Effective communication
   2. Agile methodologies
   3. Prioritization of tasks
   4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
They test individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing
They test interactions between different components or subsystems.
3.System Testing
They test the entire system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing
They test the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

These tests help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leadng to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Mthod of giving clear and concise instructions to the AI and anticipate to get the best responses from the models. This helps AI understand what exactly one needs so as to avoid getting a confusing answer.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write me an executive assistant cv
Write me a cv of an executive assistant role tailored to the job description and cv attached

It will provide me my improvised cv with the exact job description that is required for the job application.
